# TAJ Room Website
## `Overview`
The TAJ Room Website is designed to streamline and enhance the booking process for the TAJ auditorium. This website aims to bring clients closer to the roomâ€™s facilities and services without the need for an in-person visit. The primary functionality of the site is to facilitate booking dates for the auditorium and to enable clients to specify their required services through a comprehensive online form.

## `Features`
* **Online Booking Form:** Clients can fill out a form with their details such as name, identification number, and room service preferences including the number of tables, type of music, and other specific requirements.
* **Error Notification:** If any information entered by the client is incorrect or incomplete, the website sends a notification prompting the user to correct the errors and resubmit the form.
* **Service Confirmation:** Once all information is correctly submitted, the website generates a confirmation poster outlining the selected services. This poster informs the client that their reservation is under review by the room administration.
Communication: Clients are assured that they will be contacted via phone or email to confirm their reservation details.
## `Usage`
1. **Booking Form Submission:** Clients visit the website and fill out the booking form with the necessary details.
2. **Validation and Notification:** The website validates the information. If errors are found, a notification is sent to the client to correct the data.
3. **Confirmation Poster:** Upon successful validation, a poster summarizing the selected services is generated and sent to the client.
4. **Reservation Review:** The room administration reviews the reservation request.
5. **Final Confirmation:** The client is contacted by phone or email to confirm the reservation and finalize the booking.
